### Android App 
    Your mobile device will function as a datasource to play the game
    Minimal Design for now
        Default Icons "GPS Looking" / Limited color scheme

    Location Tracking
        Standard notification icon saying that it's running or "game is playing"

        Periodically record user location via GPS via background service

        (additionally a button in the app just lets you do it manually if you feel like it)
        "save location" button for this
        
        Location Data Fields (SQLite)
            user_guid
            randomid
            lat
            long
            timestamp


    Transmit to "game"

        Have a datetime for when your data was last uploaded to the game
            user can press upload to upload the newest data to the server (JSON formatted)

        Server needs error handling to return to the app if the upload was sucessful or not

        "upload" button for this

    Users in the game

        A GUID will be generated by the Android app to give you an initial user instance on the system
