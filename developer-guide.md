### Android App 
    Your mobile device will function as a datasource to play the game
    Minimal Design for now
        Default Icons "GPS Looking" / Limited color scheme

    Location Tracking
        Standard notification icon saying that it's running or "game is playing"

        Periodically record user location via GPS via background service

        (additionally a button in the app just lets you do it manually if you feel like it)
        "save location" button for this
        
        Location Data Fields (SQLite)
            user_guid
            randomid
            lat
            long
            timestamp


    Transmit to "game"

        Have a datetime for when your data was last uploaded to the game
            user can press upload to upload the newest data to the server (JSON formatted)

        Server needs error handling to return to the app if the upload was sucessful or not

        "upload" button for this

    Users in the game

        A GUID will be generated by the Android app to give you an initial user instance on the system
            
### IPhone App

        coming soon...
        
### Web Application
    
        the main game website will exist as http://shamanic.io
        
        To build the webapp Repo on a Windows Machine, follow these instructions:
        
        Download yourself a copy of PostgreSQL (currently we're at version 9.4) - here:
        http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
        
        Install it.
        
        Run pgAdmin III and make a new user "shamanic_user" under Login Roles
        Create a new database called "shamanic" under Databases
        
        In the source for the web application, visit the "db" folder, run the "scheme.sql" in the 'shamanic' database to create the required database tables for the project
        
        Run the application: 
          the expressjs binary to start the nodeJS app is in the 'bin' folder run as follows:
             $> nodejs www
